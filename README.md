- 👋 Hi, I’m @giorgionicoli
- 👀 I’m a physicist with a passion for software development and machine learning. Python is my main language!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything I can about ML and MLOps, deep learning and data-driven model development and lifecycle.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects to increase my experience. I'll finish my PhD end of January 2022 and I want to make machine learning and software development my main activities!
